      <h3 id="Left">Milspec</h3>
      <p>Milspec grade skins are the lowest possible skin you can unbox from normal cases.
      These skins tend to cost from three cents to fifty cents. This is the most common skin group.
          These skins are also obtained through drops after matches finish. If you're lucky you will get one dropped at about a 10 to 1 chance.</p>

      <h3>Restricted</h3>
      <p id="class">The restricted grade skin is a purple color class. This
      is one of the lowest ranked skin groups. This is the group that is just above the
       milspec skins. Seeing as these skin classes are the lowest, they are the easiest to obtain and
       are worth very little money compared to other skin classes.</p>
      <h3>Classified</h3>
      <p>The classified skins are one of the rarest to obtain.
      These are skins that can vary from fifty cents to 300 dollars.
      They are obtained from cases and in-game drops.
      It is about a 1 in 1,000 chance that you get a classified skin from an in-game drop.
      </p>
      <h3>Covert</h3>
      <p>This is the final rarity you can get for an unboxable gun.
      These skins tend to be the most expensive skins. They can range from 2$ to 10,000$.
      There is only one covert that is able to be dropped, and this is the "Dragon Lore".
      This is the rarest gun skin in the entire game, because it is only dropped on one map, and has a 1 to 1,000,000 chance of dropping in-game,
      or being unboxed.
      This weapon is the most costly covert skin having a price of 10,000$ for a stat trak factory new form of this weapon.</p>
