<h3>Knives and Gloves!</h3>
<p>The game CSGO contains many skins varying from as little as a few cents to thousands of dollars.
But there are a few more kinds of skins. The first being knives.
Knives are one of the rarest type of skins. Knives are able to be found in almomst every case.
The only case that won't drop a knife is the glove case. There are a huge variation of knives.
The most popular knife being the karambit. Knives will usually range from about 50$ to 10,000$.
Most expensive knife being a collectors knife, a crimson web karambit with a certain web pattern.</p>

<p>Gloves are a new kind of skin that was added to create a new rare skin making knives more rare than they were.
Gloves can be said to be the rarist skins in the game (excluding skins like the dragon lore.) but they are
not as desired as the knife.
Gloves are only foundn in a single case known as the glove case. This is a newer case added a few months ago.
Glove prices range at around 120$-500$.
The price of the gloves is chosen because they are so rare to unbox.</p>
